From Reich
==========

This is a variation of fromEno project. In this case I am trying to achieve with colors a similar effect of what Steve Reich achieved with "Pendulum Music." Pendulum music has several microphones hanging from the ceiling at different lengths. They make buzzing sounds as the microphones pass one another. At some point all of them come to a rest, and that is the end of the piece.

So in the same vain, this project has RGB color values swinging back and forth until the values reach the RGB midpoint. In color, that means reaching a gray color.
