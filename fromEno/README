This is a project inspired by listening to a lecture that Brian Eno gave at some Russian university. http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/29280342143

He described an art video that he made where the screen slowly changed colors. Or at least that is how I misheard it. So I created a project that emulates that idea.

As I remember it, the idea is that it would change color so slowly that you wouldn't be able to perceive it. So I wanted to create something that had the same feel but that changed color faster.

My other change to Eno's concept is that the color swing back and forth on the RGB values. So in a way they are three pendulums. I added a few elements of randomness for the initial values and for the speed at which they change.

It is an interesting exercise in how we find meaning. In my experience, looking at the color changes triggers me to start creating a narrative, although one witout characters, but more of changing moods.

It is a silent piece.
